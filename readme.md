#### Instruction

1. Be sure to have python 3.6. Later version are not supported by TF, especially when using Conv layers
2. Install virtual env (pip install virtualenv) and make a env (mkvitualenv name) so your modules are only installed in that env and not globally
3. Install tf (pip install tensorflow), deras (pip install keras)
4. Pull the docker image for tensor flow serving (docker pull tensorflow/serving)
